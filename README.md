### Overview

__SharpGLTF__ is a 100% .NET Standard library designed to support
[Khronos Group glTF 2.0](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF) file format.

The library is divided into two main packages:

- [__SharpGLTF.Core__](src/SharpGLTF.Core/README.md) provides read/write file support, and low level access to the glTF models.
- [__SharpGLTF.Toolkit__](src/SharpGLTF.Toolkit/README.md) provides convenient utilities to help create, manipulate and evaluate glTF models.

#### Nuget Packages

|Package|Version|
|-|-|
|[__SharpGLTF.Core__](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpGLTF.Core)|![Nuget (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/SharpGLTF.Core)|
|[__SharpGLTF.Toolkit__](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SharpGLTF.Toolkit)|![Nuget (with prereleases)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/SharpGLTF.Toolkit)|

The library is still in preview status because the APIs are still subject to change from version to version,
but most of the features are already completed and heavily tested, so I believe the code is mature enough
to be used in production.


#### Quickstart

A simple example of loading a glTF file and saving it as GLB:

```c#
var model = SharpGLTF.Schema2.ModelRoot.Load("model.gltf");
model.SaveGLB("model.glb");
```

More examples can be found [here](examples) and in the Test project.
